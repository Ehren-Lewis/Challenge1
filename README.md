HoriseonSemantics

Author: Ehren Lewis

This application is the landing paged for the company Horiseon.
I built this project because Horiseon Services wanted to outsource
the refactorization of their landing page to a freelance developer,
and I partnered with them because I stand by their company values.

I used html and css as the technolgy, and only these because their website didn'trequire dynamic browsing. 

The challenges I faced when refactoring the codewas insuring
 there were no typos when trying to add css selectors to the html elements.

I hope in the future to further refactor the code to make sure there is no repition, or possibly add some dynamic features to the website.

I learned how to refactor code to make it more concise, as well as
how to navigate a codebase that someone else has created.

Known bugs: There are some issues with the responsiveness on smaller screens
